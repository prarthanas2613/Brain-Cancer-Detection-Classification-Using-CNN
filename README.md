# Brain-Cancer-Detection-Classification-Using-CNN
Brain Cancer Detection and Classification using CNN


This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain cancer from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
The model learns deep features from medical images to assist in early and accurate diagnosis.



Objectives
- Detect presence of brain cancer from MRI scans
- Classify cancer types using CNN
- Improve diagnostic accuracy using deep learning



Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- CNN (Deep Learning)



 Dataset
- MRI brain tumor dataset  
- Dataset source:  Kaggle 



 Model Architecture
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling
- Flatten
- Dense Layers
- Softmax / Sigmoid Output



Output
-it detect the tumor yes/no and classify which type of tumor
